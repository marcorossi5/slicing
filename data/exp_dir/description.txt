Cosmic rays + proton beam sample.
This dataset contains 10 events per beam energy.
Beam energies available are: 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 GeV

Each event has 3 readout planes: U,V,W
Each readout plane is described by 8 rows:
    - energy
    - x position
    - z position
    - x expected direction
    - z expected direction
    - cluster idx
    - pandora slicer idx
    - mc slice idx
Each line with space separated values, one for each recorded calohit.
